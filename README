Experiments around forking a new process and then re-exec'ing the same
executable. I got interested in this idea as a potential way to make
multiprocess programming more pleasant.

Currently the only code is an `exec_path` function that tries to get the path of
the currently-running executable in a cross-platform way. It probably has bugs,
and has been lightly tested on Linux only.

To do:

- Does Android have /proc/self/exe?
- Which platforms will always return absolute paths? E.g. illumos getexecname(3)
  may return a relative path, and this must be interpreted relative to the
  working directory when exec was called, not the current working directory.
